@@@^TM 475.3: Prophecy must be fulfilled. The Lord says: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." @9Somebody is to come@7 in the spirit and power of Elijah, and @9when he appears@7, men may say: "You are too earnest, you do not @9interpret the Scriptures@7 in the proper way. Let me tell you how to teach @9your message@7."@8
@@@^TM 476.1: Brethren, we must not put our dependence in man. "@9Cease ye from man@7, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? You must hang your helpless souls upon Jesus. It does not become us to drink from the fountain of the valley when there is a fountain in the mountain. Let us leave the lower streams; let us come to the higher springs. If there is a point of truth that you do not understand, upon which you do not agree, investigate, compare scripture with scripture, sink the shaft of truth down deep into the mine of God's word. You must lay yourselves and your opinions on the altar of God, put away your preconceived ideas, and let the Spirit of heaven guide into all truth.--Review and Herald, Feb. 18, 1890.@3@9Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers@7@4Sister Ellen G. White.
